## Introduction
Heart disease deaths have been rising in Singapore (Singapore Heart Foundation, n.d.) and detecting cardiovascular disease (CVD) early can help to manage its entailing consequences (Sarrafzadegan & Mohammmadifard, 2019).

Our model finds its main uses in 2 applications. 

First, for medical triaging at healthcare institutions so that patients who are at higher risk of CVD complications can be attended to faster. This could come in the form of earlier medical appointment slots or priority queues. 

Second, for more targetted identification of candidates for health screening. Our model can be integrated into HealthHub, a mobile application by the government, to allow users to do a self-assessment for their CVD risks. Users who have been found to be at high risk of CVD can then be recommended to go for health screening for further follow-up actions to be taken.
